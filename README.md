# Jay's SciCasting repository

These are programs or bayesian models I've used for
determining how to bid on various [SciCast](http://scicast.org/)
questions.

Expect a mix of:

* [Python](http://www.python.org/)
* [Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org/)
* [GeNIe](http://genie.sis.pitt.edu/)
* [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) (maybe?)

Also expect minimal explanation of what's going on.

Finally: Check on [how I'm doing](https://scicast.org/#!/users/296)
on SciCast.

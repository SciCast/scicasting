You'll need:
* a SciCast account
* an API key
* to know your user ID number

Make a file for storing your user ID and API key.
It goes in ~/scicast_apikey.txt (if you don't know
what that expands to on your operating system, run
the following in python:

   import os.path
   print os.path.expanduser("~/scicast_apikey.txt")

First line is the user ID, second line is the API key, like:

```
296
a94aa000f9a94cc5
```

(No, that isn't my API key.)

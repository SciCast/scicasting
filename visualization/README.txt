In case you've ended up here without any context, the .nb file(s) are
Mathematica notebook(s).

The .cdf files are Wolfram CDF files, which can be viewed with the
CDF Player. http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/

The CDF files are all extracted from one of the notebook(s). So if you've
got Mathematica, it would be simplest to just look at the notebook(s).
